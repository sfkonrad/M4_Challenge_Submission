## Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

In this Challenge, we've assumed the roles of quantitative analysts for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. (Think Wealthfront or Betterment). To keep the costs low, the firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

We were tasked with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in our client portfolios. Top performing fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. Also to isolate the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
