## Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return

For this Project, we assumed the roles of quantitative analysts for a FinTech investing platform. The platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality. (Think Wealthfront or Betterment). To keep the costs low, this firm uses algorithms to build each client's portfolio. The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options.

We were tasked with evaluating four new investment options for inclusion in our client portfolios. We were also tasked with isolating the fund with the most investment potential based on four key risk-management metrics: 
- Daily Returns
- Standard Deviations
- Sharpe Ratios
- and Betas
